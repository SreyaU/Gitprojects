Wi-Fi PCAP anomaly detection 
Problem Statement
Impractical manual analysis for large PCAP files
High expertise requirements in QA 
Undetected anomalies on manual analysis
Prototype Tool Idea
Input: Wireshark PCAP files
Output: JSON/HTML report of detected anomalies (with severity levels)
Timestamp, protocol, port, entities, issue, reason, root cause, action items
Tech stack:
Python (Scapy, PyShark for parsing)
Pandas for feature extraction
TensorFlow for anomaly detection
Enhancements:
Simple web dashboard for visualization
JSON report forward for ticketing anomalies
Graphs and plots for better understanding and analysis
Support live traffic across platforms – Windows, Linux
Dependencies:
Python
Scapy, Tshark, Pyspark, Pyshark, Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras
Proposed AI-Enhanced Workflow
Step 1: PCAP Parsing 
Use libraries Scapy/tshark/Pyshark/Pyspark to extract features from pcap
Metrics : RSSI, SNR, MAC address, src/dst IPs, Ports, Protocols, Error counts, Retry rates, Frame loss, Packet loss, Interpacket delay, Traffic flows, etc.
Step 2: Feature Engineering
Transform raw packets into structured datasets (CSV format for training model):
Step 3: AI Analysis
Unsupervised ML: Detect unusual clusters (e.g., one AP showing abnormal retries).
Supervised ML: Classify known anomalies (trained on labeled lab datasets).
Time-series ML: Identify sudden traffic spikes or latency shifts.
Start with non-labelled data set to find anomalies --> upgrade to labelled data set for supervised learning for root cause identification
Step 4: Insights & Alerts
Generate human-readable results in JSON/HTML/EXCEL formats with required summary:
“High retry ratio detected on AP MAC: 00:1a:xx”
“Possible rogue AP with SSID spoofing”
“Latency anomaly at 14:02 – check channel overlap”
Timestamp, protocol, port, entities, issue, reason, root cause, severity, action items
Benefits
Automated analysis of pcap ? saves hours of manual inspection.
Early anomaly detection ? performance/security issues caught faster.
Scalable ? works on huge pcaps where Wireshark is impractical.
Extensible ? integrate with continuous WLAN test environments.
Example Use Cases
WLAN testing labs: Automatically detect anomalies during regression tests.
Enterprise troubleshooting: Feed pcaps into AI tool for root cause hints.
Security monitoring: Spot rogue APs or spoofed clients from trace files.

Prompt Attempt idea 1:
You are a network analyst engineer with 20+ years of expertise in everything related to networking - analyzing network logs and packet capture logs (PCAP) , have Senior level knowledge in wireshark, wireless communications including the standards, protocols, securities, etc. Ask for the service the user want initially when they are in this chat screen. Services that you should offer are as follows: 1) packet capture logs (PCAP) analysis 2) Protocol testing and analysis.
