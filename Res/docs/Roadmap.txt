🗂️ 4-Week Automation Engineer Practice Plan
Week 1: Python Automation Foundations

📌 Goal: Comfort with Python basics applied to automation.

Day 1:

Write a script that renames .txt files in a folder with today’s date.

Write another script that deletes all empty files in a directory.

Day 2:

Parse config.json to read environment details (base_url, timeout).

Write a function that switches configs between dev, qa, prod.

Day 3:

Read a users.csv file and print usernames/passwords.

Automate a script to validate if all usernames start with "user".

Day 4:

Write a script that scans .log files in a folder and extracts all "ERROR" lines.

Save extracted errors into a separate errors.log.

Day 5 (Mini-Project):

Build a log monitor: Watch a folder for .log files, and whenever a new one is created, print “New log detected”.

Week 2: Practical Automation (APIs, Files, Logging)

📌 Goal: Work with APIs, error handling, retry logic, and logs.

Day 6:

Call https://api.github.com and check if status code is 200.

Automate a retry mechanism (3 retries before failing).

Day 7:

Write a script that fetches GitHub user info from API and extracts login, id, public_repos.

Save results into users.csv.

Day 8:

Automate zipping of all .log files into logs.zip.

Extend it to automatically delete logs older than 7 days.

Day 9:

Write a function to call https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{id} for ids 1–5.

Validate that "title" field exists in the response.

Day 10 (Mini-Project):

API Health Checker:

Input: apis.csv (list of endpoints).

Output: CSV report with endpoint + status code + pass/fail.

Week 3: Test Automation with Frameworks

📌 Goal: Learn pytest, parameterization, and structured test design.

Perfect. I’ll expand this into a **structured roadmap (Beginner → Advanced)** with **scenario-based Q\&A**. Each stage builds on the last, so by following it, you’ll gradually move from a beginner automation engineer → advanced automation engineer.

---

# 🚀 Python Automation Engineer Roadmap (Scenario-Based)

---

## **Stage 1: Beginner (Foundation Layer)**

> Focus on Python basics applied to automation tasks.

### **1. Automating Repetitive File Renaming**

**Scenario:** Rename all `.txt` files in a folder to include today’s date.

```python
import os
from datetime import date

def rename_files(path):
    today = date.today().strftime("%Y%m%d")
    for file in os.listdir(path):
        if file.endswith(".txt"):
            new_name = f"{file.split('.')[0]}_{today}.txt"
            os.rename(os.path.join(path, file), os.path.join(path, new_name))

rename_files("./testdata")
```

🔑 **Concepts:** File handling, automation of mundane tasks.

---

### **2. Automating Config File Reading (JSON)**

**Scenario:** Your automation script reads config values from a `config.json`.

```python
import json

with open("config.json") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

print("Base URL:", config["base_url"])
```

🔑 **Concepts:** Externalizing configs → maintainable automation scripts.

---

---

## **Stage 2: Intermediate (Practical Automation)**

> Expand into error handling, logs, APIs, and data-driven testing.

### **3. Log Collector Automation**

**Scenario:** Collect all `.log` files and compress them into a single `.zip` for reporting.

```python
import os, zipfile

def zip_logs(log_dir, zip_name="logs.zip"):
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_name, "w") as zipf:
        for file in os.listdir(log_dir):
            if file.endswith(".log"):
                zipf.write(os.path.join(log_dir, file))

zip_logs("./logs")
```

🔑 **Concepts:** Log automation, packaging test artifacts.

---

### **4. Automating API Health Check**

**Scenario:** Continuously check if an API endpoint is alive.

```python
import requests

def check_api(url):
    try:
        r = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
        return r.status_code == 200
    except Exception as e:
        return False

print("API OK" if check_api("https://api.github.com") else "API Down")
```

🔑 **Concepts:** Error handling, resilience in automation.

---

---

## **Stage 3: Advanced (Test Automation Engineer Level)**

> Structured frameworks, retries, parametrization, CI/CD readiness.

### **5. Data-Driven API Testing with CSV**

**Scenario:** Run tests for multiple APIs from `apis.csv`.

```
endpoint
https://api.github.com
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
```

```python
import csv, requests

with open("apis.csv") as f:
    for row in csv.DictReader(f):
        r = requests.get(row["endpoint"])
        print(f"{row['endpoint']} -> {r.status_code}")
```

🔑 **Concepts:** Data-driven automation, scaling test cases.

---

### **6. Retry Logic in Test Cases (Flaky API)**

```python
import requests, time

def call_api_with_retry(url, retries=3):
    for attempt in range(retries):
        try:
            r = requests.get(url)
            r.raise_for_status()
            return r.json()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Attempt {attempt+1} failed. Retrying...")
            time.sleep(2**attempt)
    raise Exception("API failed after retries")

print(call_api_with_retry("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"))
```

🔑 **Concepts:** Stability in automation → essential for CI pipelines.

---

---

## **Stage 4: Expert (Automation Engineer → Advanced)**

> Combine frameworks, web automation, CI/CD integration.

### **7. Pytest Parametrization (Data-Driven Tests)**

```python
import pytest
import requests

@pytest.mark.parametrize("endpoint", [
    "https://api.github.com",
    "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
])
def test_api_status(endpoint):
    r = requests.get(endpoint)
    assert r.status_code == 200
```

🔑 **Concepts:** pytest integration, structured automation framework.

---

### **8. Selenium UI Automation Example**

**Scenario:** Automate login page validation.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com/login")

driver.find_element(By.ID, "username").send_keys("testuser")
driver.find_element(By.ID, "password").send_keys("password")
driver.find_element(By.ID, "login").click()

assert "Dashboard" in driver.page_source
driver.quit()
```

🔑 **Concepts:** Web UI automation, Selenium basics.

---

---

## **Stage 5: Advanced Engineer → Specialist**

> Optimize, scale, and integrate automation into CI/CD.

* **CI/CD Integration:** Run pytest suites in Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
* **Parallelization:** Use `pytest-xdist` to speed up tests.
* **Reporting:** Generate HTML/Allure reports.
* **Service Virtualization:** Mock APIs using `responses` or `httpretty`.
* **Scalability:** Move from local Selenium → Selenium Grid / Playwright for faster execution.

---

# ✅ Final 80/20 Summary

If you **master these stages**:

* **Stage 1–2:** Get started with automation (beginner → intermediate).
* **Stage 3–4:** Cover 80% of real-world automation tasks (API, data, UI tests).
* **Stage 5:** Transition into advanced automation engineer (frameworks, CI/CD).

---

Would you like me to now **design a hands-on practice plan (like daily/weekly exercises)** using these stages so you can **practice incrementally** while building a portfolio of automation scripts?
