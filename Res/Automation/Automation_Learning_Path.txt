Automation Prompt:
=============================
I want to learn automation using Robot Framework with Python, specifically focusing on Android and WLAN automation. Please create a comprehensive and structured syllabus that will guide me from a beginner level to an advanced automation engineer. The syllabus should cover conceptual knowledge, practical skillsets, and application-level understanding, ensuring I become industry-ready. Act as a professional with over 10 years of experience in this domain and explain each concept in depth with clear examples, detailed logic flow, and best practices. The curriculum should enable me to design automation logic, develop robust scripts, and effectively debug them. Organize the topics sequentially, including all essential concepts for extended learning, common real-world scenarios, and frequently asked interview questions related to each topic. After completing each module, please validate my understanding by providing sample problems or application-level questions that involve automation scripting and problem-solving in Robot Framework for Android and WLAN environments. Additionally, offer tips on tools, libraries, and frameworks relevant to these areas to enhance my practical expertise.

tutor me for the below job description with appilcation level in depth concept explanation , practical skill set validation with advanced level interview questions - programming/ scripting, theoretical/ practical wlan related questions, debugging/ logic building questions - from the jd in related topics, You can go through the topics one after the other after verifying that i have understood all the concepts and has clearly grasped and is industry ready on the concept. I need you to teach and upgrade me from beginner to advanced level.After this i should be able to handle any technical scenarios and requirement related to these concepts. ask me for the jd

* Deep knowledge of Wi-Fi technologies (Wi-Fi 5, Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E, Wi-Fi 7), IEEE 802.11 standards, and Wi-Fi Alliance certification processes.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Must-Know Modules
		Module	Purpose	Example Use Case
		os	File & directory operations	Automating file movements or backups
		sys	Script execution parameters	Reading command-line args
		shutil	File operations (copy, move, archive)	Auto archiving logs or configs
		subprocess	Run system commands	Calling shell tools like ffmpeg, git, etc.
		glob	Pattern matching for filenames	Batch processing .log or .csv files
		re	Regular expressions	Text parsing, log extraction, validations
		datetime	Time/date parsing	Timestamping files, scheduling reports
		json, csv	Data serialization and reading	Handling APIs and log data
		requests	HTTP API interactions	Automation via REST APIs
		time, sleep	Delay operations	Rate limiting, retries
		argparse	Command-line argument parsing	Writing flexible CLI tools
		logging	Logging automation scripts	Production-quality debug messages

ðŸ”¹ 2. Preferred / Bonus Modules (Good to Know)
		Module	Why Learn It
		pathlib	Modern alternative to os.path
		pyautogui	GUI automation (keyboard/mouse actions)
		schedule	Lightweight task scheduling (cron-like)
		threading, multiprocessing	Run tasks in parallel or asynchronously
		pprint	Pretty print complex data structures
		yaml	For reading config files (e.g., .yaml)
		smtplib, email	Email alerts or automation via email
		zipfile, tarfile	Compressing/archiving logs or builds
		openpyxl, xlrd, pandas	Excel/CSV automation for reports
		selenium	UI/browser automation
		watchdog	Monitor folder changes in real time

ðŸ”¸ 3. Testing-Specific Libraries
		Tool/Module	Use Case
		unittest	Built-in testing framework
		pytest	Industry-favorite, elegant test writing
		mock	Mocking objects, APIs, DB calls
		coverage	Test coverage reports
		requests-mock	Mocking REST APIs in tests
		selenium, playwright	Web UI testing
		behave	BDD testing (given-when-then style)
		allure-pytest	Rich test reporting

ðŸ§  Sample Interview Qs
		When would you prefer subprocess.run() over os.system()?

		How do you mock an API call in pytest?

		What's the use of argparse in writing CLI tools?

		Difference between pathlib and os.path?

ðŸ§ª Practice Projects Ideas
		Project	Modules to Use
		File backup & archive script	os, shutil, zipfile, datetime
		REST API data fetcher	requests, json, argparse
		Cron-replacement script	schedule, time, logging
		Website checker + alert	requests, smtplib, logging
		Excel auto reporting	openpyxl, pandas, datetime
		Auto file downloader	requests, os, re, threading

ðŸ“Œ Tip:
Use help(module) or dir(module) to explore any module interactively.
